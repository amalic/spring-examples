===============

All projects here are eclipse projects. You'll need m2eclipse for dependency management.

You'll also need lombok enabled in your IDE, otherwise you need to add getters, setters, equals and hashcode methods to the model-components.

Tested with Eclipse 3.7.2, Lombok 0.11.6, Apache Tomcat 7.0.23, JDK7
